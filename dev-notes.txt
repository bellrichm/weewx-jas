Architectural/Design Points
- Do not use ajax calls. This will allow the 'site' to be hosted without a web server.
- Site should work directly from the file system (file://index.html).
- Each 'page' is an iframe. The MQTT connection is established on the main page. 
  This allows the MQTT connection to stay connected when changing pages/iframes.
- The MQTT data is passed from the main window to the iframes via a postMessage.
- The size of the iframe is passed to the main page via a postMessage.
