- By default, disable the debug pages.
- By default, disable the radar section.
- Default an observation’s echart type to line, the most common.

- Include a favicon.
- Log generation of additional pages.

V0.2.2-rc03
Fixes:
- Wrong label used for 'summed' observations (#32)
- Continual learning and cleanup in support of setting data binding.

- Reinstated the experimental wind and rain icons in the forecast section. (#36)
- Add unit labels to the 'this date' section. (#35)
- Internationalize forecast section (#43)

- Add some default observations in the 'current', 'min/max', and 'this date' sections.
- Option to not update 'current' observations from MQTT. 
  Useful for 'sum' observations like rain and ET.
- Dependent javascript library versions are configurable. (#41)
- Whether to use minified javascript libraries is configurable.
- Update ECharts to 5.3.3.
- Number of decimal places in charts defaults to 2. This can overriden when defining charts vie ECharts' 'valueFormatter' option. (#42)

- Force known javascript booleans to lowercase. (#53)
- Close menu on item selection. (#44)
- Configure 'year to year' x-axis label format. (#47)

V0.3.0
New:
- Dynamic language display. All 'language based' UI elements are dynamically populated.
  This allows the UI to display based on the browser settings or even based on user choice.
  The data is populated from WeeWX's lang files, so the translation process is the same as other skins.
  Note: Currently user defined charts can only be in one language. See #80
Enhancements:
- 'max decimals' is configurable in all tabular data.
- Improved display of collapsed menu.
- Legend moved to bottom. Improves display on small screens. (#79)

- Bootstrap version updated to 5.3.0.

V0.4.1

- jas always gets ‘current’ data from the db.
  This fixes the case where a current xtype is in an alternate binding.
  In this case the data to calculate the xtype will never be in the archive record.

Enhancements:

- Added option to configure the number of columns a section should use.

V1.0.0

Breaking Change:
The 'topics = ' and '[[[[[fields]]]]]' have been moved under a [[[[[topics]]]]] section.
See https://github.com/bellrichm/weewx-jas/wiki/MQTT for additional information.

- Ability to subscribe to multiple MQTT topics.
- Improved look of navigation bar.
- Charts can be opened in a modal/pop-up window.
- Current observations can be opened in a modal/pop-up window.

Internal:
- Improved performance of generating charts by caching data across page generation (#107).
- Removed unused 'suffix' code.

V1.1.0

This is a complete rewrite of WeeWX-JAS management and loading of WeeWX data, resulting in these improvements.
- Refreshing data no longer requires a full page refresh/reload. 
  This is true for both the refresh button and automated refreshes.
- An option to add a query string to data requests has been added. 
  This allows WeeWX-jas to leverage the internet's cache infrastructure.
  See, https://github.com/bellrichm/weewx-jas/wiki/Pages#query_string_on for additional information.
- The data generated from WeeWx is now only generated once per aggregate interval.
- Page html is only generated once, on the first report cycle after WeeWX startup.
- Data helper javascript functions are only generated once, on the first report cycle after WeeWX startup.

Fixes:
- 'Current' and 'Min/Max' sections are now optional.
- 'Landing page' is now optional.
- Handle the case where the WeeWX default value for 'unit_system' is missing.
- Raise an exception during generation if the WeeWX default value for 'lang' is missing.
- Correct UTC offset used for min/max date time display.
- Handle non-numeric, like N/A, current observation values.

Additional Enhancements:
- Additional debug logging.

V1.1.1

Fixes:
- Missing files when installing (#132).
- Handle missing currentObservations (#135).
- Missing latest month/year in dropdown (#136).
